    Tiramisu
 </strong>
  is a timeless no - bake Italian dessert combining espresso - dipped ladyfingers and a creamy lightly sweetened mascarpone cream .
    This recipe is from the late Maida Heatter and is easily the best homemade tiramisu recipe that I've ever tried .
</p>
<br>
<p>
    A couple months ago , I was sent a new cookbook called Happiness is Baking . This cookbook includes Maida Heatter's favorite recipes with
the foreword written by Dorie Greenspan . I , unsurprisingly , immediately fell in love with my newest cookbook . It's a collection of 100
foolproof and classic desserts including cookies , cakes , muffins , pies , tarts , and more that range from simple everyday cookies to
outrageously indulgent chocolate souffl√© cake .

    For those not familiar , Maida Heatter  is an icon, especially in the baking world. Dubbet the Queen of Cake, her expansive culinary career inculded 9 cookbooks, recips for the Times, a restuarant, and three James Beard Awards. Baker and author Dorie Greenspan once said "Whenever someone tells they want to learn to bake , I tell them to start with Maida Heatter's books. That's what I did." This is latesy cookbook is a testament to Maida's legacy. She passed away only 2 months after this book was published. She leaves an incalculable amount of inspiration to bakers  and cooks all over the world.

<h1>Common Tiramisu Questions - Answered</h1>
<dl>
    <dt><b>What kind of rum do I use in tiramisu?</b></dt>
    <dd>
        Dark rum is best, but you can use brandy or your favorite coffe liqueur .
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dt> <b>Egg whites or whipped cream?</b> </dt>
    <dd>Most tiramisu recipes use whipped egg whites OR whipped cream in the mascarpone cream layers. Egg whites contribute a more airy texture, while whipped creams makes the filling a bit more rich. This recipe uses both, so you're getting both delightful textures.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt><b>Are the eggs cooked?</b></dt>
    <dd>Tiramisu is a no-bake desert. The egg youlks are gently cooked on the stovetop, but the egg whites are raw. Purchase pasteurized eggs because they are safe to consume raw.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt><b>What size pan to use ?</b></dt>
    <dd>This particular tiramisu recipe yields a large volume and the pan will be very full. Make sure your pan is large enough. I recommend a 9x13 inch dish with at least a 12-14 cup capacity. This 4 quart dish is wonderful too.</dd>
